- Delete feature branches after merging

### Branch Management
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `dev`: Development integration (auto-deploys to staging)
- `feature/*`: New features
- `fix/*`: Bug fixes
- `docs/*`: Documentation updates

### Deployment
- **Staging**: Auto-deploys from `dev` branch
- **Production**: Manual deployment from `main` branch
- **Platform**: Coolify-managed server with Docker
