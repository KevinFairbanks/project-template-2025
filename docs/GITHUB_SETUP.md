# GitHub Actions Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the manual setup steps needed to enable our GitHub Actions workflows for build & package functionality.

## üîß Required Manual Setup Steps

### 1. Repository Secrets Configuration

Navigate to your repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions

**Required Secrets:**
```yaml
# Coolify Deployment (if using GitHub-triggered deployment)
COOLIFY_WEBHOOK_URL: "https://your-coolify-instance.com/webhooks/deploy/your-app-id"
COOLIFY_API_TOKEN: "your-coolify-api-token"  # Optional for advanced features

# Container Registry (Automatic with GitHub)
GITHUB_TOKEN: # Automatically provided by GitHub Actions

# Optional: Notifications
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."  # If re-enabling Slack
```

**How to get Coolify webhook URL:**
1. Go to your Coolify dashboard
2. Select your application
3. Go to "Webhooks" tab
4. Copy the deployment webhook URL
5. Add to GitHub repository secrets

### 2. GitHub Container Registry Setup

**Automatic Configuration:**
- GitHub automatically provides `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- Container registry is enabled by default
- Images stored at: `ghcr.io/your-username/your-repo`

**Manual Verification:**
1. Go to repository ‚Üí Packages tab
2. After first workflow run, verify images appear
3. Images are tagged with branch name and commit SHA

### 3. Environment Protection (Optional for Single Dev)

**For Production Safety:**
1. Go to repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environments
2. Create "production" environment
3. Add protection rules:
   - Required reviewers: Add yourself
   - Wait timer: 0 minutes (for solo dev)
   - Deployment branches: Only `main`

**Benefits for Solo Dev:**
- Manual approval step before production
- Prevents accidental deployments
- Can be skipped if not needed

### 4. Branch Protection Rules (Optional)

**Recommended for Quality:**
1. Go to repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch:
   - ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass
   - ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date
   - ‚úÖ Status checks: `quality-checks`, `build-and-package`
   - ‚ùå Require pull request reviews (not needed for solo)

### 5. Workflow Permissions

**Automatic Setup:**
- Workflows have read/write permissions by default
- Can push to container registry
- Can create releases and tags

**Manual Verification:**
1. Go to repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General
2. Verify "Workflow permissions" is set to "Read and write permissions"

## ü§ñ Automated Features Already Configured

### Container Registry Management
```yaml
# Automatically handled:
- Image building for AMD64 + ARM64
- Tagging with branch and commit SHA
- Pushing to GitHub Container Registry
- Build caching for faster subsequent builds
- Multi-stage Docker optimization
```

### Quality Gates
```yaml
# Runs automatically on every push/PR:
- ESLint code linting
- Prettier formatting checks
- Jest test execution with coverage
- npm audit for security vulnerabilities
- Dependency review (PRs only)
```

### Deployment Triggers
```yaml
# Staging (dev branch):
- Automatic deployment after quality passes
- Health check validation
- Rollback on failure

# Production (main branch):
- Manual approval required (if environment protection enabled)
- Extended health checks
- Automatic release creation with changelog
```

## üîÑ Workflow Integration Options

### Option 1: GitHub + Coolify Hybrid (Recommended)
```yaml
Flow:
1. Developer pushes to dev/main
2. GitHub runs quality checks + builds images
3. GitHub triggers Coolify webhook on success
4. Coolify deploys using pre-built image
5. Health checks validate deployment

Benefits:
- Quality gates prevent bad deployments
- Pre-built images for faster deployment
- Coolify handles server management
- Best of both worlds
```

### Option 2: Pure Coolify (Current Setup)
```yaml
Flow:
1. Developer pushes to branch
2. Coolify detects changes
3. Coolify builds and deploys directly

Benefits:
- Simpler setup
- Real-time deployment
- Zero GitHub configuration needed

Limitations:
- No quality gates
- No pre-built images
- No deployment history in GitHub
```

### Option 3: Pure GitHub Actions (Advanced)
```yaml
Flow:
1. Developer pushes to branch
2. GitHub runs full CI/CD pipeline
3. GitHub deploys directly to server
4. GitHub manages entire process

Benefits:
- Complete control over deployment
- Rich deployment history
- Advanced automation possibilities

Limitations:
- More complex server setup
- Requires server access configuration
- More maintenance overhead
```

## üì¶ Container Registry Benefits

### For Development
- **Consistent environments** across local, staging, production
- **Faster deployments** using pre-built images
- **Version tracking** with tagged images
- **Rollback capability** to previous image versions

### For Scaling
- **Multi-server deployment** using same images
- **Load balancer compatibility** with identical containers
- **Development team** can use same images locally
- **CI/CD flexibility** with portable containers

## üéØ Recommended Setup for Your Use Case

**As a single developer with Coolify:**

### Minimal Setup (Start Here)
1. ‚úÖ Keep existing Coolify auto-deployment
2. ‚úÖ Add GitHub quality checks (prevent bad code)
3. ‚úÖ Enable container registry (future-proofing)
4. ‚ùå Skip environment protection (not needed solo)
5. ‚ùå Skip branch protection (not needed solo)

### Enhanced Setup (When Ready)
1. ‚úÖ Add GitHub ‚Üí Coolify webhook integration
2. ‚úÖ Enable environment protection for production
3. ‚úÖ Add automated release creation
4. ‚úÖ Set up deployment notifications

### Full Setup (Multi-Developer Future)
1. ‚úÖ Enable branch protection rules
2. ‚úÖ Require PR reviews
3. ‚úÖ Add team environment approvals
4. ‚úÖ Set up advanced monitoring

## üöÄ Quick Start Commands

**To enable workflows in new project:**
```bash
# 1. Copy workflow files from template
cp -r .github/ /path/to/new-project/

# 2. Update repository-specific values in workflows
# Edit .github/workflows/ci.yml:
# - Update image names
# - Update health check endpoints
# - Update notification settings

# 3. Add required secrets to new repository
# (Follow steps in section 1 above)

# 4. Push to trigger first workflow run
git push origin dev
```

**To test workflow locally:**
```bash
# Install act (GitHub Actions local runner)
# Windows (using chocolatey):
choco install act-cli

# Run workflow locally
act push -W .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

## üìã Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures
- **Check Docker syntax** in Dockerfile
- **Verify package.json scripts** exist (test, lint, build)
- **Ensure Node.js version** matches in package.json and Dockerfile

### Permission Errors
- **Verify GITHUB_TOKEN** has packages:write permission
- **Check workflow permissions** in repository settings
- **Ensure secrets** are added to correct repository

### Deployment Failures
- **Verify Coolify webhook URL** is correct
- **Check application health endpoint** returns 200
- **Ensure environment variables** are set in Coolify

### Container Registry Issues
- **Check package visibility** (public vs private)
- **Verify image tags** are being created
- **Ensure cleanup policies** don't delete recent images

This setup gives you professional-grade CI/CD while maintaining the simplicity of your current Coolify workflow!
